            <strong>Introduction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Continuous integration (CI) refers to the process of automatically evaluating your code as it is updated by
            yourself and contributors, to try and catch any potential issues your updates have caused. A CI workflow
            typically includes automatic execution of many of the steps, such as running tests, calculating code
            coverage, and building documentation, among others.</p>
        <p>Continuous deployment (CD) is the process of automating the deployment of new versions of your software to
            e.g., PyPI, from changes that have made it through CI.</p>
        <p>CI/CD also helps others contribute to your package, because the process of updating your package is automated
            and doesn’t depend on one person’s expert knowledge (i.e., yours) of how to make releases manually. Even if
            your package won’t be updated very often, setting up CI/CD is still beneficial because it means you don’t
            have to remember all the manual steps required to make a release of your package (which can be daunting and
            deter you from wanting to update and maintain your package).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>GitHub Actions is a service for running continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes. The basic
            concept is to build a collection of commands that GitHub Actions will execute on our behalf. We call this
            set of commands a “workflow”. A GitHub Actions workflow is defined in a .yml file and comprises the
            collection of “actions” we want GitHub Actions to conduct for us. In a workflow, actions are grouped as
            "steps," which are then sorted into "jobs" (e.g., job 1: continuous integration). When a process is
            triggered by a specific "event," it is executed on a machine provided by GitHub Actions called a "runner"
            (like merging code into the main branch of a repository).

        <p><strong>steps for Heroku CI/CD</strong></p>
        <p>1.Create an account with Heroku, create an app for production and an app for development</p>
        <p>2.Create a new repo in Docker hub</p>
        <p>3.Setup Docker and Heroku Credentials In the Repository Settings under Action -> Secret
        <ul><li>In your newly created Github repository, add new repository secrets for DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD, HEROKU_API_KEY (Values are DOCKER_USERNAME: your docker hub username; DOCKER_PASSWORD: your docker hub password; HEROKU_API_KEY: API key from the heroku app)</li></ul></p>
<p>Get the heroku API key from account in: -> applications -> create authorization button</p>
        <p>5.generate prod yml files with the link to docker image, production environment and registered mail id for heroku application</p>
        <p>6.generate dev yml file with the link to development environment and registered mail id for heroku application</p>
        <p>7.Push code to your local repo and check for any errors and fix any errors that appear when the workflow is running. You can check the workflow in the actions</p>
