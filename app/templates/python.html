                    <p>The database management system not only aids in the effective storage of data, but also in the
                        sharing of
                        data throughout the business. Programmers, system administrators, and end-users are all involved
                        in such an
                        environment. There are five components in a database environment: data, hardware, software,
                        people, and
                        procedures. Multiple users can easily access the data and share it with other users without
                        having to go
                        through any additional steps. In only a few seconds, the system can assist you find the
                        information you need
                        from a big database. As a result, managing various sorts of data, such as student records,
                        employee
                        information, inventory, payroll, project management, and so on, is extremely effective for
                        organizations.

                    <p></p>
                    <p>PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming
                        language. It
                        helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI. PyTest is mainly
                        used for
                        writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to complex functional
                        tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pytest assertions are checks that return either True or False status. In Python Pytest, if an
                        assertion fails
                        in a test method, then that method execution is stopped there. The remaining code in that test
                        method is not
                        executed, and Pytest assertions will continue with the next test method.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the code for this Project the pytest has been performed for each webpage by asserting a value
                        from each.
                        Intitally the pytest failed due to snake case style, the pytest checks if all the variable names
                        are
                        starting with lowercase and the words are seperated only by the underscore. After fixing the
                        issue the
                        pytest was Successful.

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Flask is a backend framework that is used to build web applications. A framework is a foundation
                        for
                        developing applications and it contains several in-built modules and libraries which makes the
                        process
                        easier for developers. It provides a structure for developers to follow while creating a web
                        app.
                    </p>
                    <p>Back end engineers, full stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps
                        engineers are
                        some of the web development positions that require Python.
                    </p>
                    <p> itâ€™s basically a reusable code that provides specific functionality that can be used in your
                        programs. In
                        short, a framework is a collection of libraries and modules that help you develop faster and
                        smarter
                        applications. Apart from Flask, there are several other software frameworks developed for
                        various
                        functions.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title"><strong>Setting up Pytest on Flask</strong></h2>
                    <p>With the command <strong>pip install pytest</strong> you can install Pytest. Once the
                        installation is
                        done,<strong> import pytest</strong> helps to import modules from the pytest.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Naming convention for files:</strong> keep your tests in a <strong>tests</strong>
                        directory in the
                        root folder of the application. Pytest recommends that test file names begin with the format
                        <strong>test_*.py</strong>
                        or end with format <strong>**_test.py</strong>, Using these formats enables Pytest to
                        auto-discover the test
                        files easily and also minimizes confusion when running tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this project I have included the tests to make sure that I receive atleast one combination of
                        words
                        provided in the assertion.</p>
                    <p><strong>testing with pytest</strong> To run Pytest tests, you can either use py.test or pytest in
                        the
                        terminal. You can also run a single file by explicitly specifying the filename after the Pytest
                        command:
                        pytest (your filename).py. When these commands are executed, Pytest automatically finds all the
                        tests in
                        either the root directory, or in the specified single file.

                        When no test files have been explicitly defined, Pytest executes any tests in the root directory
                        that follow
                        the standard naming pattern, without you needing to specify filenames or directories.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pytest marks a passed test with a green dot .; it marks a failed test with a red F. Count the
                        number of dots
                        or Fs to figure out how many tests passed and failed, and in what execution order.
                    </p>
