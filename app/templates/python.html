            <strong>What is Python?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The database management system not only aids in the effective storage of data, but also in the sharing of
            data throughout the business. Programmers, system administrators, and end-users are all involved in such an
            environment. There are five components in a database environment: data, hardware, software, people, and
            procedures. Multiple users can easily access the data and share it with other users without having to go
            through any additional steps. In only a few seconds, the system can assist you find the information you need
            from a big database. As a result, managing various sorts of data, such as student records, employee
            information, inventory, payroll, project management, and so on, is extremely effective for organizations.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p><strong>What is pytest?</strong>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming language. It
            helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI. PyTest is mainly used for
            writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to complex functional tests.
        </p>
        <p>Pytest assertions are checks that return either True or False status. In Python Pytest, if an assertion fails
            in a test method, then that method execution is stopped there. The remaining code in that test method is not
            executed, and Pytest assertions will continue with the next test method.
        </p>
        <p> In the code for this Project the pytest has been performed for each webpage by asserting a value from each.
            Intitally the pytest failed due to snake case style, the pytest checks if all the variable names are
            starting with lowercase and the words are seperated only by the underscore. After fixing the issue the
            pytest was Successful.
        </p>

        <p><strong> Python Flask</strong>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Flask is a backend framework that is used to build web applications. A framework is a foundation for
            developing applications and it contains several in-built modules and libraries which makes the process
            easier for developers. It provides a structure for developers to follow while creating a web app.
        </p>
        <p>Back end engineers, full stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps engineers are
            some of the web development positions that require Python.
        </p>
        <p> it’s basically a reusable code that provides specific functionality that can be used in your programs. In
            short, a framework is a collection of libraries and modules that help you develop faster and smarter
            applications. Apart from Flask, there are several other software frameworks developed for various
            functions.</p>
        <p> Here is the <a href="https://github.com/sagar-alande/docker-nginx">Git</a> link to the project i have worked
            on with flask. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

        <p><strong>Setting up Pytest on Flask</strong>
        </p>
        <p>With the command <strong>pip install pytest</strong> you can install Pytest. Once the installation is
            done,<strong> import pytest</strong> helps to import modules from the pytest.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Naming convention for files:</strong> keep your tests in a <strong>tests</strong> directory in the
            root folder of the application. Pytest recommends that test file names begin with the format <strong>test_*.py</strong>
            or end with format <strong>**_test.py</strong>, Using these formats enables Pytest to auto-discover the test
            files easily and also minimizes confusion when running tests.
        </p>
        <p>In this project I have included the tests to make sure that I receive atleast one combination of words
            provided in the assertion.</p>
        <p><strong>testing with pytest</strong> To run Pytest tests, you can either use py.test or pytest in the
            terminal. You can also run a single file by explicitly specifying the filename after the Pytest command:
            pytest (your filename).py. When these commands are executed, Pytest automatically finds all the tests in
            either the root directory, or in the specified single file.

            When no test files have been explicitly defined, Pytest executes any tests in the root directory that follow
            the standard naming pattern, without you needing to specify filenames or directories.
        </p>
        <p>Pytest marks a passed test with a green dot .; it marks a failed test with a red F. Count the number of dots
            or Fs to figure out how many tests passed and failed, and in what execution order.
        </p>

                        <li>templates-- has all the HTML pages required for the project</li>
                        <li>_init_.py-- project initialization script invokes the base HTML script </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>tests -- has all the pytest files for each page in the project</li>

                    <li>docker-compose.yml-- Orchestration file that contains the configuration to develop locally, it overrides the Dockerfile to run the flask development server instead of running the gunicorn server that is used for hosting on Heroku</li>
                    <li>Dockerfile -- File used to create an image to run in a container that runs the program</li>
                </ul>
