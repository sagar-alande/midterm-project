            <strong>Introduction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>GitHub is a version management and collaboration tool for programming. It allows you and others to
            collaborate on projects from any location.
        </p>
        <p>Here we will discuss about
        </p>
        <p>
            • Repositories
        </p>
        <p> • Branches
        </p>
        <p> • Commit
        </p>
        <p> • Merging of requests
        </p>
        <p> • Tags
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Repository</strong></p>
        <p>
            Typically, a repository is used to organize a single project. Repositories can hold anything your project
            need, including folders and files, photos, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. A README file, which
            contains information about your project, is frequently included in repositories. The Markdown language is
            used to write README files. This <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet </a> will
            help you get started with Markdown syntax. When you create
            a new repository on GitHub, you can add a README file at the same time. Other common options, such as a
            license file, are available on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> Creating Repository</p>
        <p>1.After logging in, in the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New
            repository.</p>
        <p>2.In the Repository name box, enter your desired repo name, Adding description is optional</p>
        <p>3.Select whether your repository will be <strong>Public or Private</strong>.</p>
        <p>4.Click Create repository.</p>
        <p></p>

        <p><strong>Branch</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>A branch is a version of a repository that exists in two places at the same time. It is contained within the
            repository, but it has no effect on the primary or main branch, allowing you to operate freely without
            causing any disruption to the "live" version. You can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish
            your modifications once you've finished making the changes you desire.</p>
        <p>
            Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of
            your repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the
            default branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other
            people are making to the repository. A branch you create to build a feature is commonly referred to as a
            feature branch or topic branch
        </p>
        <p> When we create any new repository in GitHub, the GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. This
            branch is default branch for repository, and it's the branch that will be shown to anyone visiting your
            GitHub Profile. When you try to clone the repository code, the default branch will be cloned unless you have
            selected specific branch to code. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Git Commit</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we work, adding commits allows us to keep track of our progress and modifications. Each commit is treated
            as a "save point" by Git. It's a time in the project where you can go back and fix a bug or make a
            modification.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should always provide a message when we commit. It's easy for you (and others) to know what's changed and
            when by adding clear messages to each commit.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Description about commit</strong>Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index
            and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip
            of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it.
            The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:
        </p>
        <p> •before using the commit command, use <strong>git-add .</strong> to incrementally "add" changes to the index
            (Note: even updated files must be "added")
        </p>
        <p> •before performing the commit command, by using <strong>git-rm</strong> to remove files from the working
            tree and index
        </p>
        <p> •by passing files as arguments to the commit command (without the —interactive or —patch options), which
            causes the commit to disregard changes staged in the index and instead record the current content of the
            listed files (which Git must already be aware of)
        </p>
        <p> •by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all known files and to
            automatically "rm" files in the index that have been deleted from the working tree, before actually
            committing
        </p>
        <p> •before concluding the transaction, by using the —interactive or —patch switches with the commit command to
            pick one by one which files or hunks should be included in the commit, in addition to contents in the index.
        </p>
        <p> The <strong>--dry-run</strong> option can be used to obtain a summary of what is included by any of the
            above for the next commit by giving the same set of parameters
        </p>
        <p>If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from it with <strong>git
            reset</strong>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Merge</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The "merge" command is used to integrate changes from another branch. The target of this integration (i.e.
            the branch that receives changes) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Git can perform most integrations automatically, some changes will result in conflicts that have to be
            solved by the user. The great part of Git's merging process is that it uses the familiar edit/stage/commit
            workflow to resolve merge conflicts. When you encounter a merge conflict, running the <strong>git
            status</strong> command shows you which files need to be resolved.When Git encounters a conflict during a
            merge, It will edit the content of the affected files with visual indicators that mark both sides of the
            conflicted content. These visual markers are: <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. Its helpful to search a project
            for these indicators during a merge to find where conflicts need to be resolved.Generally the content before
            the ======= marker is the receiving branch and the part after is the merging branch.
            <strong>Git merge</strong> will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most
            frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Some important options of merge</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>--no-ff</strong>Creates a merge commit even when a fast-forward would be possible.
        </p>
        <p><strong>--squash</strong>Combines all integrated changes into a single commit, instead of preserving them as
            individual commits.</p>
        <p><strong>--abort</strong>When a conflict occurs, this option can be used to abort the merge and restore the
            project's state as it was before starting the merge.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Tags</strong></p>
        <p>Annotated tags can be created in GitHub Desktop. Tags are linked to commits, so you may use them to designate
            a specific point in your repository's history, such as a release's version number.</p>
        <p>By default, GitHub Desktop will push the tag that you create to your repository with the associated
            commit.</p>
        <p>Creating a tag:</p>
        <p>1.Click <strong>History</strong>.</p>
        <p>2.Right-click the commit and click <strong>Create Tag</strong>. provide the tag name</p>
        <p>3.Click <strong>Create Tag</strong> .</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Viewing tags</p>
        <p>1. click on <strong>History</strong></p>
        <p>2. Click on Commit</p>
        <p>3. All tags connected with a commit are displayed in the metadata for that commit.</p>
